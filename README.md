This project was created to help me learn about APIs and may include some common errors since I am a beginner.
Uses runelite api to find out which is the best item to merch currently on the popular multiplayer game Old School Runescapeusing price difference and trade volume.

Right now, im using the formula (price diff) * (buy/sell ratio) * (high price volume) to work out a score to rank the items with.
If anyone has a better method of assessing how good an item is merch then dont hesitate to get in contact with me.

Each entry the ItemScores list is formatted as such: [score,name of item,high price volume].
