This project was created to help me learn about APIs and may include some common errors since I am a beginner.
Uses runelite api to find out which is the best item to merch currently on the popular multiplayer game Old School Runescape using price difference and trade volume.

Right now, im using the formula (price diff)/low selling price * (buy/sell ratio) * ln(high price volume) to work out a score to rank the items with.
If anyone has a better method of assessing how good an item is merch then dont hesitate to get in contact with me.


the first subentry in each entry of the list returned by get item scores is the score that this formula generated
